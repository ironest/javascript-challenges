## Capitalise the Front
*(exercise_01.js)*

Create a function that will take a string as an argument. In this function, use your favourite loop to capitalise the first letter of each word, whilst making each other letter lowercase

* **E.g.** capitaliseTheFront("sinGLE"), should return "Single"

* **E.g.** capitaliseTheFront("TWO words"), should return "Two Words"

* **E.g.** capitaliseTheFront("Quite a Long SENTENCE!"), should return "Quite A Long Sentence!"

## Challenge
*(exercise_02.js)*

1. Create a Dog class. Each dog should have a name and a location.
2. Add a speak method that logs "Woof! my name is {name}"
3. Add a walk method that accepts two arguments: location (string) and distance (integer)
4. Add a display_walks method that console.logs all of the dog's walks
5. Add a total_distance method that returns the total distance of all the walks
6. Research: what's the difference between console.log and return? Make sure you have a solid understanding

## Beast Mode
*(exercise_03.js)*
1. Create a Walk class with properties: location and distance
2. Update your Dog class: when the walk method is called, use this new Walk class to create a walk
3. Introduce a timestamp to each walk, automatically add the current time when you instantiate a walk

## Beast Mode++
*(exercise_04.js)*
1. Create a basic GUI in the browser to interact with your classes. Use buttons, prompts and lists to create and display dogs (view example).
2. Add walks to the GUI. I.e. add a `New Walk` button to each dog and display their walks under their name.
