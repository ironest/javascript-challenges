## Challenge
*(convert_to_promises.html)*

1. Download the [Random User web app](https://coderacademyedu.github.io/resources/convert_to_promises.html.zip). Open the code in your editor and run it in your browser. Take some time to understand the code. A solid understanding of the code will help you in your next step.
2. The code is currently using XMLHttpRequest. Update the code to use Fetch instead. You'll be working with Promises! Pro tip: you should only need to modify the getRandomUser function. Don't forget error handling :)
