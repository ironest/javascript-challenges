Let's build a todo list. Only use plain old vanilla JavaScript, don't use any JS frameworks. Don't worry about styling for now. [Here's what we're building](https://coderacademyedu.github.io/resources/vanilla_js_todo_demo.html).

We'll build an ugly version first before we worry about styling.

1. Add an input box and a button to your app.
2. When the user clicks the button, make a new todo item appear on the page.
3. Set the input box back to an empty value when a task is added.
4. Show the total number of tasks somewhere.
5. We should be using forms with our input! Wrap your input box and button in a form. Make sure the button is a submit button. You'll need to update your event listener from `on button click` to `on form submit`. Pro tip: preventDefault will be helpful here.
6. We can remove the button. Pressing enter will submit the form.
7. Use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to make it look similar to the demo.

1. Update the input functionality. It should also search the tasks as a user types.
2. Refreshing the page wipes all our data! Find a way to persist data.
