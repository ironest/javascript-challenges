*(api_review)*

Hit this API `https://pokeapi.co/` and get all the information on a Pokemon of your choice (eg growlithe).

Look over the data that comes back and create a function that pulls off the different moves names associated with it. Print the array to the screen and show either Garret or myself. (edited)
